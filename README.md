# radar-map

This project shows an example of how to add a weather radar overlay to Google Maps. It also provides the option for animating the radar.

Two overlays are used, northern radar and southern radar, since the full US radar doesn't exactly line up Google Maps presumably due to using different map projections.

A Google Maps API key is necessary to make this work. You can add your own API key to the radar-map.js file for testing purposes.
